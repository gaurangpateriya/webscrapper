0,Spotify-backed Sonos ties up with ‘Soundtrack Your Brand’ for business streaming,The Sonos deal could also channel more money to music companies and artists. Commercial streaming commands much higher price than the consumer equivalent -- $30 a month versus the industry standard of $10 a month.,"A Spotify-backed music streaming company will be exposed to hundreds of thousands of potential new customers through a tie-up with U.S. speaker manufacturer Sonos Inc.Soundtrack Your Brand Sweden AB licenses its music catalog of 50 million songs to be played in public venues such as shops and restaurants for about $30 a month. The service will now be available to as many as 300,000 businesses using Sonos speakers, Soundtrack Chief Executive Officer Ola Sars said in an interview.The Sonos deal could also channel more money to music companies and artists. Commercial streaming commands much higher price than the consumer equivalent -- $30 a month versus the industry standard of $10 a month, in this instance, for access to a broadly similar catalog of songs.Store owners are obliged to pay for a commercial music license if they play songs in public, but rates often vary based on complicated factors, such as the square-meter size of a venue. The growth of the music streaming market created an opportunity for companies like Soundtrack to simplify the system with flat-rate packages.The former chief operating officer of Apple Inc.’s Beats Music, who co-founded Soundtrack in 2013, said revenue from businesses taking advantage of the product would be split between the two companies. He declined to specify the ratio of the split.Soundtrack, which counts Adidas and McDonald’s as customers, used Spotify Technology SA’s catalog for its first 18 months of operations, but has since moved to build its own library of music. It now has 50 million songs after the company secured some 6,500 licensing deals with rights holders including Sony/ATV Music Publishing.For Sonos, offering legal streaming music with its business-focused speaker setups could add a recurring revenue stream and help the company diversify from its main business of selling premium home speakers to consumers. Soundtrack estimates that 21.3 million businesses worldwide aren’t paying for licensed music, which at $30 a month for a licensed service represents a shortfall of $7.7 billion.That potential has attracted new players, and rumors that Apple may be getting in to the fray has been circulating since it was reported last year that the company had registered the trademark Apple Music for Business. A push by the iPhone maker could move the market to become more tightly regulated and increase takeover interest for Soundtrack Your Brand, Sars said.“If Apple chooses to do this, others will look at it too, and then it may be a good idea to look at us instead of building it yourself,” Sars said. “I have no interest in selling the company, but that is a good development.”Santa Barbara, California-based Sonos went public in August, and has also partnered with IKEA to offer speakers doubling as furnishing. Soundtrack Your Brand’s investors include Balderton Capital, Northzone and Swedish carrier Telia Co.(Updates with CEO quotes in 8th, 9th paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Niclas Rolander in Stockholm at nrolander@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rebecca Penty at rpenty@bloomberg.net, ;Niklas Magnusson at nmagnusson1@bloomberg.net, Nate Lanxon, Nick RigilloFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.

1,"Amazon’s new machines now box up orders, could eliminate thousands of jobs ","Amazon is famous for its drive to automate as many parts of its business as possible, whether pricing goods or transporting items in its warehouses. But the company is in a precarious position as it considers replacing jobs that have won it subsidies and public goodwill.","Amazon.com Inc is rolling out machines to automate a job held by thousands of its workers: boxing up customer orders.The company started adding technology to a handful of warehouses in recent years, which scans goods coming down a conveyor belt and envelopes them seconds later in boxes custom-built for each item, two people who worked on the project told Reuters.Amazon has considered installing two machines at dozens more warehouses, removing at least 24 roles at each one, these people said. These facilities typically employ more than 2,000 people.That would amount to more than 1,300 cuts across 55 U.S. fulfillment centers for standard-sized inventory. Amazon would expect to recover the costs in under two years, at $1 million per machine plus operational expenses, they said.The plan, previously unreported, shows how Amazon is pushing to reduce labor and boost profits as automation of the most common warehouse task – picking up an item – is still beyond its reach. The changes are not finalized because vetting technology before a major deployment can take a long time.Amazon is famous for its drive to automate as many parts of its business as possible, whether pricing goods or transporting items in its warehouses. But the company is in a precarious position as it considers replacing jobs that have won it subsidies and public goodwill.ALSO READ: Amazon dismisses idea automation will eliminate all its warehouse jobs soon“We are piloting this new technology with the goal of increasing safety, speeding up delivery times and adding efficiency across our network,” an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement. “We expect the efficiency savings will be re-invested in new services for customers, where new jobs will continue to be created.”Amazon last month downplayed its automation efforts to press visiting its Baltimore fulfillment center, saying a fully robotic future was far off. Its employee base has grown to become one of the largest in the United States, as the company opened new warehouses and raised wages to attract staff in a tight labor market.A key to its goal of a leaner workforce is attrition, one of the sources said. Rather than lay off workers, the person said, the world’s largest online retailer will one day refrain from refilling packing roles. Those have high turnover because boxing multiple orders per minute over 10 hours is taxing work. At the same time, employees that stay with the company can be trained to take up more technical roles.ALSO READ: Meet Scouts, Amazon’s cooler-sized autonomous delivery robotsThe new machines, known as the CartonWrap from Italian firm CMC Srl, pack much faster than humans. They crank out 600 to 700 boxes per hour, or four to five times the rate of a human packer, the sources said. The machines require one person to load customer orders, another to stock cardboard and glue and a technician to fix jams on occasion.CMC declined to comment.Though Amazon has announced it intends to speed up shipping across its Prime loyalty program, this latest round of automation is not focused on speed. “It’s truly about efficiency and savings,” one of the people said.Including other machines known as the “SmartPac,” which the company rolled out recently to mail items in patented envelopes, Amazon’s technology suite will be able to automate a majority of its human packers. Five rows of workers at a facility can turn into two, supplemented by two CMC machines and one SmartPac, the person said.The company describes this as an effort to “re-purpose” workers, the person said.It could not be learned where roles might disappear first and what incentives, if any, are tied to those specific jobs.But the hiring deals that Amazon has with governments are often generous. For the 1,500 jobs Amazon announced last year in Alabama, for instance, the state promised the company $48.7 million over 10 years, its department of commerce said.PICKING CHALLENGEAmazon is not alone in testing CMC’s packing technology. JD.com Inc and Shutterfly Inc have used the machines as well, the companies said, as has Walmart Inc, according to a person familiar with its pilot.Walmart started 3.5 years ago and has since installed the machines in several U.S. locations, the person said. The company declined to comment.Interest in boxing technology sheds light on how the e-commerce behemoths are approaching one of the major problems in the logistics industry today: finding a robotic hand that can grasp diverse items without breaking them.Amazon employs countless workers at each fulfillment center who do variations of this same task. Some stow inventory, while others pick customer orders and still others grab those orders, placing them in the right size box and taping them up.Many venture-backed companies and university researchers are racing to automate this work. While advances in artificial intelligence are improving machines’ accuracy, there is still no guarantee that robotic hands can prevent a marmalade jar from slipping and breaking, or switch seamlessly from picking up an eraser to grabbing a vacuum cleaner.Amazon has tested different vendors’ technology that it may one day use for picking, including from Soft Robotics, a Boston-area startup that drew inspiration from octopus tentacles to make grippers more versatile, one person familiar with Amazon’s experimentation said. Soft Robotics declined to comment on its work with Amazon but said it has handled a wide and ever-changing variety of products for multiple large retailers.Believing that grasping technology is not ready for prime time, Amazon is automating around that problem when packing customer orders. Humans still place items on a conveyor, but machines then build boxes around them and take care of the sealing and labeling. This saves money not just by reducing labor but by reducing wasted packing materials as well.These machines are not without flaws. CMC can only produce so many per year. They need a technician on site who can fix problems as they arise, a requirement Amazon would rather do without, the two sources said. The super-hot glue closing the boxes can pile up and halt a machine.Still other types of automation, like the robotic grocery assembly system of Ocado Group PLC, are the focus of much industry interest.But the boxing machines are already proving helpful to Amazon. The company has installed them in busy warehouses that are driving distance from Seattle, Frankfurt, Milan, Amsterdam, Manchester and elsewhere, the people said.The machines have the potential to automate far more than 24 jobs per facility, one of the sources said. The company is also setting up nearly two dozen more U.S. fulfillment centers for small and non-specialty inventory, according to logistics consultancy MWPVL International, which could be ripe for the machines.This is just a harbinger of automation to come.“A ‘lights out’ warehouse is ultimately the goal,” one of the people said.

3,69% Indian firms face serious cyber attack risk: Study,"Around 83 % of organisations in the Asia Pacific region do not think about cyber security while embarking on digital transformation projects, according to the study.","Kuala Lumpur, May 13 (IANS) While 69 per cent Indian and 63 per cent Australian companies are most at risk of cyber attack, 35 per cent of organisations in the region suffered at least one cyber security incident in the last 12 months, says a sector study.According to a recent study by leading IT analyst firm Frost &Sullivan, findings of which were released on May 9 here by Forcepoint, a leader in global cyber security, around 83 % of organisations in the Asia Pacific region do not think about cyber security while embarking on digital transformation projects.Although a majority of the organisations (72 %) conduct regular breach assessment to protect themselves against cyber attacks, still 55 % of them continue to be at risk.“It’s clear from this study that many APAC organisations are on the back foot when it comes to enterprise cyber security in the borderless organisation,” said Kenny Yeo, Industry Principal, APAC ICT, Frost &amp; Sullivan.With 95 % of respondents having embarked on a digital transformation journey, adopting emerging technologies, including cloud computing, mobility, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence/machine learning, the study reveals a big push among APAC organisations for digitization.However, 65 % of respondents acknowledged that they were seriously hampered in execution of digital transformation projects due to rising cyber attacks.One of the key reasons for this is the less mature approach by business leaders to involve cyber security when designing digital transformation projects. It is also evident from the fact that around 83 % of the companies did not consider cyber security until after their digital transformation projects had begun.Cloud has become one of the key components that is leading digital transformation with 69 % of firms adopting cloud. But 54 % of respondents perceive that their cloud service provider will take the full responsibility for security.Normally, security and compliance are a shared responsibility between an organisation and the cloud service provider. This serious misconception around responsibility of security in the cloud is resulting in a higher number of cyber attacks, says the study.The finding suggests the majority of companies have taken measures to protect themselves against cyber incidents, with 72 % of them performing breach assessments at least once per quarter. Despite the readiness, 55 % of organisations were at risk -- either they have encountered a security incident before or they did not do any checks to assess if they have been breached.The Frost &amp; Sullivan study reveals the impact digital transformation is having on each organisation’s risk posture. As more digital technology is built into business like cloud and mobility, it is opening each firm up to more threats.Data exfiltration, impersonation -- both theft of digital identity and online brand impersonation -- as well as loss of intellectual property and malware infection emerged as the top security blind spots for companies rolling out digital transformation. They have high levels of business impact and long recovery times, says the study.Over 400 organisations across Asia Pacific participated in this study, with 100 respondents each from Australia, Hong Kong, India and Singapore. They hailed from key industries like financial services, telecom, manufacturing, energy &amp; utilities, retail, education and health care.While 53 % respondents were from large enterprises, the rest were from mid-sized enterprises and small and medium businesses. Around 75 % respondents were C-level executives and senior IT and security decision makers.

9,"HTC Exodus 1s blockchain phone announced, set to cost $250-300",HTC aims to democratise blockchain and cryptocurrency with an affordable Exodus 1s smartphone. ,"HTC has announced a new version of its blockchain phone, HTC Exodus 1s. The phone will go on sale in the third quarter of this year. As the name implies, the new phone is a cheaper version of the main variant HTC Exodus 1 launched in October last year. The phone is expected to be priced between $250 and $300. The new phone, however, comes with several new features including full node capabilities. It will also come with Bitcoin blockchain. With Exodus 1s, HTC is hoping to create a bigger decentralised network – necessary to push the adoption of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. A cheaper price point is expected to help HTC reach out to newer users interested in cryptocurrencies. “We are democratizing access to the technology for a free world. Full nodes are the most important ingredient in the resilience of the Bitcoin network, and we have lowered the barrier to entry for any person to run a node, which is simply a computer, mobile in our case, participating in a global Bitcoin network that propagates transactions and blocks everywhere, which is the foundation and fundamental definition of a peer-to-peer cash system,” said HTC.HTC said it will be revealing full specifications and other features of the phone in coming weeks. The predecessor features a 6-inch HD+ display. It runs on Snapdragon 845 processor with 6GB of RAM and 128GB built-in storage. Other key specifications of the Exodus 1 include 3,500mAh battery, IP68 certification, and 16-megapixel dual rear cameras. HTC Exodus 1s will join a very small set of blockchain phones which are available in select markets. Last year, Switzerland-based Sirin Labs launched the world’s first commercial blockchain phone, Finney. Sinagpore-based Pundi X offers a dedicated blockchain-focused operating system.

10,These iPhones may not get Apple’s next iOS 13 update,Apple’s next iOS 13 update could make these iPhone models outdated soon. ,"Apple is reportedly going to make an unpopular decision with its iOS 13 update – dropping support for iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone SE and older iPhones. The company may also keep iPad mini 2 and iPad Air out of its iOS 12 coverage. While iPad mini 2 and iPad Air are quite old models, the decision to remove iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is going to draw criticism. These two models are among the most popular iPhones ever and are still selling in markets like India. Even Apple iPhone SE is available in the market. Each year Apple releases new iOS iteration with new updates and features. Following criticism over deliberately throttling performances of older devices, Apple made some radical changes with iOS 12 update last year. One of the biggest talking points of iOS 12 was that it retained compatibility with iPhones as old as iPhone 5S. Apple’s decision to drop support for iPhone 6 and other models is being considered as a ploy to push older users to newer iPhones. Since 2017, Apple has launched as many as three new iPhone models. The company is going to continue the trend in 2019 as well. The catch, however, is that despite adding three new models each year, a lot of old users aren’t upgrading – hitting the company’s revenues. Apple is already grappling with weakened sales in key markets including India. According to the company, iPhone sales dropped by 17% compared to the year prior. Despite sales plummeting and company’s new services push, iPhone still accounts for 54% of the company’s business. Last year, it had about 61% of share.

It uses less storage, making it an ideal option for older phones with limited capacity.“When Spotify launched in India two months ago, we had committed to localising the app so that more and more people can listen to music.“Spotify Lite Beta is a step in that direction as it enables users to play millions of songs for free, takes up less space on phones, and saves data when used on the go,” Amarjit Batra, Managing Director India, Spotify, told IANS on Monday.The lighter app can be downloaded separately (via Play Store) and can be used either alongside or independently from the main Spotify app.“Our ambition is to be available on all platforms that make sense to our users, and make the music streaming experience as seamless as possible,” Batra added.Spotify Lite lets you play your favourite songs and artists on demand, discovers new music, keeps track of storage (has control over cache and ability to clear it), keeps track of data and works on all low-end Android phones in all network conditions.The app works when the network is patchy, users are struggling with the Internet or for when they don’t want to spend much mobile data.The main Spotify app that came to India is February had amassed one million followers within the week of its launch.Spotify, offering more than four crore songs and 300 crore playlists for music fans in the country, is available across 79 markets.

However, there’s still a lot of confusion within the public and the media regarding what is ML and AI.","The most buzzed-about disruptive technologies that are changing business landscapes today are Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Almost all of us have heard or read about them but do we actually know what the fuss is all about?The enterprises are trying to harness the explosion of digital data and computational power with advanced algorithms to enable collaborative and natural interactions between people and machines.However, there’s still a lot of confusion within the public and the media regarding what is ML and AI.People prefer to write AL and ML technologies -- and not ML and AI -- and the argument goes that the former syncs well with the human mind.  Both the terms are often being used as synonyms and in some cases as discrete, parallel advancements. In reality, ML is to AI what neurons are to human brain. Let us start with ML.ALSO READ: Facebook AI scans videos of real people to turns them into game charactersAccording to Roberto Iriondo, Editor of Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania, ML is a branch of AI.As coined by computer scientist and machine learning pioneer Tom M. Mitchell, “ML is the study of computer algorithms that allow computer programmes to automatically improve through experience”. For instance, if you provide an ML model with songs that you enjoy, along with audio statistics (dance-ability, instrumentality, tempo or genre), it will be able to automate and generate a system to suggest you music that you’ll enjoy in the future, similarly as to what Netflix, Spotify and other companies do.“In a simple example, if you load an ML programme with a considerable large data-set of X-ray pictures along their description (symptoms etc), it will have the capacity to assist (or perhaps automatise) the data analysis of X-ray pictures later on,” said Iriondo. ALSO READ: IIT-Jodhpur to set up India’s largest Artificial Intelligence supercomputerThe ML model will look at each one of the pictures in the data-set, and find common patterns in pictures that have been labelled with comparable indications.  AI, on the other hand, is exceptionally wide in scope and is a system in itself and not just independent data models.  In simpler terms, AI means creating computers that behave in the way humans do.However, according to Theo van Kraay, Cloud Solution Architect (Advanced Analytics &amp; AI), Customer Success Unit at Microsoft, any attempt to try to define AI is somewhat futile, since we would first have to properly define “intelligence”, a word which conjures a wide variety of connotations. “Firstly, it is interesting and important to note that the technical difference between what used to be referred to as AI over 20 years ago and traditional computer systems, is close to zero,” says van Kraay. What AI systems today are doing reflects an important characteristic of human beings which separates us from traditional computer systems - human beings are prediction machines. Many AI systems today, like human beings, are mostly sophisticated prediction machines. “The more sophisticated the machine, the more it is able to make accurate predictions based on a complex array of data used to train various (ML) models, and the most sophisticated AI systems of all are able to continually learn from faulty assertions in order to improve the accuracy of their predictions, thus exhibiting something approximating human intelligence,” van Kraay said.Most ML algorithms are trained on static data sets to produce predictive models, so ML algorithms only facilitate part of the dynamic in the definition of AI.  Fifty years ago, a chess-playing programme was considered a form of AI. Today, a chess game would be considered dull and antiquated, due to the fact that it can be found on almost every computer.“AI today is symbolised with human-AI interaction gadgets like Google Home, Apple Siri and Amazon Alexa or ML-powered video prediction systems that power Netflix, Amazon and YouTube,” says Iriondo. In contrast to ML, AI is a moving target and its definition changes as its related technological advancements turn out to be further developed. “Possibly, within a few decades, today’s innovative AI advancements will be considered as dull as flip-phones are to us right now,” quips Iriondo.

14,Elon Musk’s brain tech startup ‘Neuralink’ is raising more cash,The venture has both awed and repelled various Musk watchers over the possibilities that it seemingly offers for connecting brains to computers.,"Neuralink, a small and secretive brain computing startup founded by Elon Musk, has raised $39 million of a planned $51 million funding round, according to a filing Friday with the Securities andExchange Commission.It was not immediately clear if the funders included traditional venture capital investors or if they comprised Musk and Neuralink employees. A spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Two years ago, the company said in a filing that it had raised $27 million of a planned funding round of as much as $100 million.Neuralink was registered as a California medical research company in 2016and has operated quietly from San Franciscosince then. The company has hired away several high-profile neuroscientists from various universities and contracted with a laboratoryat the University of California,Davisto conduct research on primates.The venturehas both awed and repelled various Musk watchers over the possibilities that it seemingly offers for connecting brains to computers. In March,a paper by a group of researchers affiliated with Neuralink was posted online. It outlineda novel technique for implanting electrodes into rat brains.In April, when asked by aTwitter user for a Neuralink update, Musk replied“Probably something notable to announce in a few months.”Separately, Tim Gardner, a co-founder of Neuralink and a prominent early hire for the company, is taking a jobas a professor of neuroengineering at the University of Oregon. He joined Neuralink from Boston University in March 2017.

15,HTC to exit Chinese smartphone market: Report,For now HTC is still selling devices through its own official store as well as the VIVE flagship physical store in Shenzhen. ,"Taiwanese handset maker HTC’s recent decision to pull its phones from two of China’s largest e-commerce sites strongly suggests that it is perhaps looking to exit the Chinese smartphone market.“Due to the consideration of HTC China’s long-term business strategy, we will temporarily close the HTC mobile phone Jingdong flagship store and Tmall flagship store. HTC smartphones and accessories can still be purchased through HTC Official Mall and HTC VIVE Flagship Store. We will continue to provide quality pre-sales and after-sales service as always,” HTC announced on Weibo, according to the Android Central.Jingdong and Tmall are two of China’s largest e-commerce sites, so this would essentially be like a company deciding to stop selling its phones on Amazon and B&H in the US, the report added late on Friday.For now the smartphone player is still selling devices through its own official store as well as the VIVE flagship physical store in Shenzhen. However, the former doesn’t have devices such as the U11 or U11+ in stock anymore, so it may not be long until that gets shutdown too.The Taiwanese smartphone maker had a rough 2018 when its revenue dropped to an all-time low.According to the handset maker’s year-end 2018 numbers, it took in just NT$23.74 billion (or $770 million) during 2018, the lowest in all its years as a public company.A year ago, rumour mills were abuzz that search engine giant Google would acquire HTC but the former ended up just buying HTC’s Pixel team in a $1.1 billion deal. According to the deal, over 2,000 HTC engineers are moving over to Google.HTC’s contract manufacturing operations and VR division were reportedly not affected, but a substantial majority of the smartphone R&D team went on to join Google.

The web player, which was first spotted back in March, has a similar set of playback controls to the dedicated Google Podcasts app that launched on Android in 2018. “You can skip forwards and backwards, control playback speed, and if you’re signed in with a Google Account then it should sync your playback across multiple devices,” the report said. However, the interface only lets user browse episodes from a single podcast at a time, at least as of now. Earlier in April, Apple also updated the web interface for Podcasts to allow it to play episodes directly on web, the report added.

Here’s our detailed review of the new budget phone."",""publisher"": {""@type"": ""Organization"",""name"": ""Hindustan Times"",""sameAs"": ""https://www.hindustantimes.com/""}}Redmi 7 is the latest budget smartphone from Xiaomi. The successor to Redmi 6-series, which launched in India almost six months ago, comes with several upgrades including design improvements and better specifications. With price starting at Rs 7,999, Redmi 7 is sandwiched between Redmi Go and premium Redmi Note 7 phones. As expected from Xiaomi, the latest Redmi 7 smartphone checks all the boxes for a solid budget smartphone. It features 6.26-inch HD+ display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 processor, 4,000mAh battery, 12-megapixel and 2-megapixel dual rear cameras, and expandable storage up to 512GB. Very few phones at the price point or cheaper can match this set of specifications. Just like newer Redmi Note 7 series, the Redmi 6 successor has also received the much-needed design upgrade. Gone is the boat-shaped iPhone X-lookalike notch on the top. Redmi 7 comes with a tinier and less distracting dot notch on the front. Coupled with a 19:9 HD+ display, Redmi 7 catches up with the latest phones similar screen design layout. The back panel has now glass-like finish. The black colour may not be the best looking one, but you can consider the Comet Blue and Lunar Red colour variants as well. Xiaomi’s Redmi 7 feels slightly heavy at 180 grams and is quite thick too at 8.47mm. Volume and power buttons, however, are well within the reach. The fingerprint sensor on the back is also easily accessible. While Xiaomi has definitely worked on the looks of the phone, the design implementation could have been slightly better. For instance, edges feel sharper than usual. ALSO READ: Realme 3 Pro ReviewBut there’s a lot going for Redmi 7. The 12-megapixel and 2-megapixel dual rear cameras deliver good results in daylight conditions. You can further enhance the images by switching on the AI and HDR modes. There’s also a Pro mode in the camera for further personalisation. For a Rs 7,999 phone, Redmi 7 does a good job. Lowlight images could have been much better, but that’s something a lot of phones in this category and even more expensive phones haven’t been able to fix. Xiaomi Redmi 7 handles day-to-day tasks with ease. From hours of YouTube streaming to browsing and instant messaging, Redmi 7 lives up to our expectations. You can play PUBG on the phone as well. While basic games run pretty smooth on the phone, graphic-intensive apps may lag a bit. The 4,000mAh battery is a welcome upgrade. The phone can easily last more than a day if you’re a light user. For power users, Redmi 7 can still deliver almost day-long backup. Other elements such as call quality and speakers are fine. Verdict At Rs 7,999, Xiaomi Redmi 7 is definitely worth considering. If you have Rs 1,000 extra, you can get a better model with 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage. If your budget is more flexible, you can get the base model of Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 which is priced at Rs 9,999. The Note 7 also offers better Snapdragon 660 processor.

24,Mark Zuckerberg rejects call to break up Facebook,Zuckerberg said that Facebook’s budget for safety this year is bigger than the whole revenue of the company when it went public earlier this decade.,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has rejected the call for breaking up his company, saying the size of Facebook is actually a benefit to its users and the security of the democratic process.In an interview with French broadcaster France 2, Zuckerberg dismissed the claim made by his long-time friend and Facebook Co-founder Chris Hughes that it is time to break up Facebook as Zuckerberg has yielded “unchecked power and influence” far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government”.“When I read what he wrote, my main reaction was that what he’s proposing that we do isn’t going to do anything to help solve those issues.“So I think that if what you care about is democracy and elections, then you want a company like us to be able to invest billions of dollars per year like we are in building up really advanced tools to fight election interference,” Zuckerberg told France 2 while in Paris to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron.In an opinion piece in The New York Times on Thursday, Hughes said the government must hold Mark (Zuckerberg) accountable.“Mark’s personal reputation and the reputation of Facebook have taken a nose-dive,” wrote Hughes, who during his freshman year at Harvard University in 2002, was recruited by Zuckerberg for Facebook.ALSO READ: Facebook rejects co-founder call for company breakupZuckerberg said that Facebook’s budget for safety this year is bigger than the whole revenue of the company when it went public earlier this decade.“A lot of that is because we’ve been able to build a successful business that can now support that. You know, we invest more in safety than anyone in social media,” reports TechCrunch, quoting Zuckerberg.Hughes has written that Zuckerberg has surrounded himself with a team that reinforces his beliefs instead of challenging them.“Mark is a good, kind person. But I’m angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,” he wrote.Embroiled in users’ data scandals, Facebook is set to create new privacy positions within the company that would include a committee, and external evaluator and a chief compliance officer.Facebook has already kept aside $3 billion, anticipating a record fine coming from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) related to the Cambridge Analytica data scandal that involved 87 million users.The Facebook case is being looked at as a measure of the Donald Trump administration’s willingness to regulate US tech companies.

27,‘Not just phones or PCs’: Google’s Android successor Fuchsia OS focuses on cross-platform capabilities,"Google is said to replace Android with Fuchsia, a new operating system built from scratch. But what Google is really trying to achieve with the new OS? Android chief Lockheimer shares his vision. ","Google has finally broken silence on its Fuchsia OS, an experimental operating system said to succeed Android. At Google’s recently clouded I/O developer conference, Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer disclosed some details about the much-awaited Fuchsia OS. As expected, Fuchsia OS will retain Android’s legacy of being open-source but the company’s focus isn’t just shifting millions of smartphones to the next operating system. According to Lockheimer, Google’s next OS will try to bring uniformity between all kind of devices ranging from phones, PCs to smart home devices. The Google executive also pointed out that the operating system is still in developmental phase. “We’re looking at what a new take on an operating system could be like. And so I know out there people are getting pretty excited saying, ‘Oh this is the new Android,’ or, ‘This is the new Chrome OS,’” Lockheimer told TheVerge. “Fuchsia is really not about that. Fuchsia is about just pushing the state of the art in terms of operating systems and things that we learn from Fuchsia we can incorporate into other products,” he added. ALSO READ: List of Android Q Beta 3 compatible phones, how to download,and more It’s probably the first time Google has officially detailed its upcoming operating system. Thus far, the elusive OS has always been spotted in excerpts of codes, prototype UIs and test devices. Last year, a Bloomberg report revealed that Fuchsia has been built from scratch and is part of Google’s bigger mission of overcoming limitations of Android. The company had also begun experimenting with Fuchsia OS apps featuring interactive screens and voice commands on YouTube. With smart home speakers and other Internet of Things devices becoming a hot market, Google cannot completely rely on Android to cover all kinds of products. The company is already grappling with a big fragmentation of its software which has compelled it to launch iterations like Android Go. So far, there’s no word on the availability of Fuchsia OS. It’s highly unlikely a reference device will be launched anytime sooner. Evidently, reports of Honor Play becoming first phone to run Fuchsia OS were not true.

Nike mainly relies on the feet of star athletes to build its kicks.“Nikes will become better and better fitting shoes for you and everyone else,” says Michael Martin, who oversees Nike’s websites and apps.Nike won’t sell or share the data to other companies, Martin says. And he says shoppers don’t have to save the foot scans to their Nike accounts. But if they do, they’ll only have to scan their feet once and Nike’s apps, websites and stores will know your dimensions every time you need to buy sneakers. Workers at Nike stores will also be equipped with iPods to do the scanning, replacing those metal sizing contraptions.The challenging part for Nike is convincing people they need to measure their feet in the first place. Most think they already know what their shoe size is, says Brad Eckhart, who was an executive at shoe store chain Finish Line and is now a principal at retail consultancy Columbus Consulting,But Nike says it gets half a million complaints a year from customers related to fit and sizing. And it admits what many shoppers have already suspected: Each of its shoe styles fit differently, even if they are in the same size. A leather sneaker may be tighter and require a bigger size. Knit ones may be more forgiving. And shoelaces can throw everything off.Shoe size is “effectively a lie,” says Martin. “And it’s a lie that we’ve perpetuated.”Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at NPD Group Inc., says the tool might be most valuable for people want to run or play basketball in their sneakers, since the wrong fit can cause injury. But Powell says most people buy sneakers just to walk around in.Still, finding the right size is a problem for shoppers: “There really is no industry standard for what is a size 10,” Powell says.

29,"US adults are spending big on video games, playing mostly on smartphones: ESA report","Nearly 65% of US adults, or more than 164 million people, play games. The most popular genre is casual games, with 60% of players gaming on their smartphones, though about half also play on personal computers and specialised consoles.","The average American video gamer is 33 years old, prefers to play on their smartphone and is spending big on content -- 20% more than a year ago and 85% more than in 2015, a report showed on Thursday.The annual research from the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) comes as more American households rethink how to set limits for kids who love gaming and how to allocate their entertainment budgets in the streaming era.   The $43.4 billion spent in 2018 was mostly on content, as opposed to hardware and accessories. Of pay-to-play games, “Call of Duty: Black Ops III”, “Red Dead Redemption II” and “NBA 2K19” took the top spots for most units sold but the list did not include free games such as Fortnite.“Games are striking an important chord with American culture,” said Stanley Pierre-Louis, ESA’s acting president and chief executive officer. “That’s what makes it the leading form of entertainment today.”Nearly 65% of US adults, or more than 164 million people, play games. The most popular genre is casual games, with 60% of players gaming on their smartphones, though about half also play on personal computers and specialized consoles.Parents are limiting screen time for their kids and using video game ratings to screen content, and 87% of parents require permission for new game purchases, the study showed. Some 46% of all gamers are female, though they favor different kinds of games than men, particularly depending on age.Female gamers between 18 and 34 years old prefer “Candy Crush”, “Assassin’s Creed” and “Tomb Raider” and play most often on smartphones, while their male counterparts mostly play games on consoles, particularly “God of War”, “Madden NFL” and “Fortnite.”Gen Xers, who are 40 to 54 years old, lean towards “Tetris”, “Pac-Man”, “Call of Duty”, “Forza” and “NBA 2K.”Male baby boomers aged 55 to 64 like “Solitaire” and “Scrabble”, while women lean towards “Mahjong” and “Monopoly.”Game players were no more prone than other Americans to live isolated, sedentary lives, according to the report. Americans will soon have even more ways to play video games. Apple Inc is launching a game subscription service and Alphabet Inc’s Google announced a video game streaming service late this year.The new services will present challenges to established video game developers like Electronic Arts Inc, maker of “Apex Legends”; Tencent Holdings Ltd’s Riot Games, maker of “League of Legends”; Valve Corp, owner of “Counter-Strike” and the Steam distribution platform; and Activision Blizzard Inc, owner of “Call of Duty” and “Candy Crush.”Ipsos gathered data from more than 4,000 Americans to conduct the study for the ESA.

30,"Amazon Echo smart speaker for kids violated privacy law, advocacy groups say","A complaint was filed to the FTC saying that Amazon’s Echo Dot Kids Edition infringes on children’s privacy rights. The company retains voice recordings indefinitely and, in some cases, holds onto their personal data even after users tried to delete it, according to the complaint.","A coalition of children’s advocacy organizations is asking US regulators to investigate whether Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo kids smart speaker violates privacy law.The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and the Center for Digital Democracy, joined by several other interest groups, plans to file a complaint Thursday with the Federal Trade Commission saying Amazon’s Echo Dot Kids Edition infringes on children’s privacy rights. The company retains voice recordings indefinitely and, in some cases, holds onto their personal data even after users tried to delete it, according to the complaint.Those practices violate the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, said Josh Golin, executive director of the CCFC.“Given that Amazon has the money to pay the best corporate privacy attorneys that money can buy, it seems really strange that this was done in such a way that it does violate COPPA in so many ways,” said Golin, who added that Amazon’s system “does feel like it was designed to confuse parents,” rather than protect their children’s privacy.In an emailed statement, an Amazon spokesperson said: “FreeTime on Alexa and Echo Dot Kids Edition are compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.” The company pointed customers to its Alexa website if they want more information.U.S. Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who helped write COPPA, said in a letter to the FTC, joined by other senators, that the new findings raise “serious concerns about the extent to which the Echo Dot Kids Edition complies” with elements of the law.The CCFC was among the groups critical of Amazon a year ago when the Seattle company first released a kid-focused variant of its popular Echo smart speaker line.Encased in colourful rubber protectors, the hockey puck-sized devices come with Amazon’s Alexa voice software and features like parental controls and advertising-free radio stations. Also included is a year of Amazon’s FreeTime, a subscription service that offers a curated selection of kid-focused applications.The devices, the CCFC contended last year, invaded kids’ privacy and risked outsourcing elements of parenting to corporate-controlled software. Supported by a grant from the Rose Foundation, the Boston-based organization enlisted lawyers with Georgetown Law’s Institute for Public Representation to probe Amazon’s privacy practices.To read more:Thousands of Amazon Workers Are Listening to What You Tell AlexaAmazon’s Alexa Reviewers Can Access Customers’ Home AddressesThe lawyers say they uncovered several potential violations of COPPA, which was passed two decades ago and restricts how companies can use data collected from kids younger than 13.In the complaint, the groups say Amazon does not adequately verify that they have parental consent to begin collecting data and, afterward, provides inadequate disclosures on what personal information it collects and how Amazon and third parties use that data. Only 15% of the Alexa applications tailored for kids included a link to a privacy policy at all, the complaint says.The advocates also argue that a privacy feature designed to let parents delete elements of kids’ personal information did not seem to actually erase that knowledge from the software’s memory.Researchers tried deleting facts they’d previously asked Alexa to remember, as well as the software’s entire history of voice recordings, only to find Alexa could still recite a child’s phone number, address and other personal details on command. In their testing, the only way to actually erase all of the personal information scooped up about a specific child was to delete that child’s profile entirely.“We tried multiple ways, multiple time periods, to delete things, but it comes back anyhow,” said Angela Campbell, a professor of law and co-director of Georgetown Law’s institute. “There doesn’t seem to be any way other than discontinuing the service to stop that.”Amazon says most kid-friendly skills, or Alexa applications, don’t have privacy policies because they don’t collect personal information. Skills associated with FreeTime, the company says, don’t have access to or collect user’s data.The focus on Amazon is the latest effort by kids’ advocacy groups to push the FTC to scrutinize the privacy behaviors of big technology firms. Similar complaints with the regulator in the last year targeted Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.The FTC, the main federal agency charged with enforcing privacy law, declined to comment on a complaint it hadn’t received.Musical.ly, the popular teen video app now known as TikTok, earlier this year agreed to pay $5.7 million to settle claims that it illegally collected children’s personal information.“The FTC responds to pressure from Capitol Hill, and there is so much interest on Capitol Hill in regulating the big tech companies” Golin said. “We’re hopeful that in this changed climate they will take these incredibly serious violations by Amazon seriously.”

","The iPhone XR was the most popular smartphone in North America during the first quarter (Q1) of 2019, with nearly 4.5 million units shipped, even as handset shipments declined 18% year-on-year (YoY), according to Canalys Research estimates.Smartphone shipments in North America plummeted to a five-year low of 36.4 million units, down from a record high of 44.4 million units shipped in Q1 2018.The iPhone maker shipped 14.6 million devices in Q1 2019 in total, compared to 17.9 million devices shipped during Q1 2018. “Apple’s fall in Q1 followed particularly high shipments of flagship iPhones in the previous quarter. But there was a disconnect between channel orders and consumer demand, which then caused early shipments in Q1 to be challenging for Apple,” Vincent Thielke, Analyst, Canalys Research, said in a statement.Despite the decline, the company managed to maintain 40% market share in North America, one of the regions where it sees strong performance. The next best was Samsung’s Galaxy S10+ and Galaxy S10e, which reached two million units, or 6%, each.“Samsung also benefited from carrier promotions in Q1, which used the Galaxy S10e as an incentive,” said Thielke.Samsung, with a 29.3% market share, shipped 10.7 million devices, LG 4.8 million devices and Lenovo shipped 2.4 million devices.

33,TSMC begins production of 5 nanometre chips: Report,TSMC’s new 5nm chipsets should offer 6-12% reduction in power consumption and 20% higher transistor density compared to the current 7nm process.,"The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, has begun risk production of 5 nanometre (nm) chipsets that would be featured in future super-efficient flagship smartphones and expects to be ready to begin mass production in the first half of 2020.“The mass production of the new standard is scheduled for 2020 if everything goes as planned. This process will introduce chips that will have up to 45 per cent area reduction, also bringing a performance gain up to 15 per cent compared to the current 7nm chipsets. “The new standard will also bring improvements in the architecture and should allow manufacturers to employ bigger batteries and some new technology in future smartphones,” Giz China reported on Friday.For chipsets coming out later this year, TSMC has the 7nm+ process ready. It should offer 6-12% reduction in power consumption and 20% higher transistor density compared to the current 7nm process. There is plenty of customers that are already looking forward to the new standard. Apple for example only has TSMC as its main supplier until 2020, the company will likely be responsible for the chips inside the newer 2019 iPhones, the report added.

34,Facebook rejects co-founder call for company breakup,Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes called for the breakup of the company in three. Facebook is the biggest social network has more than 2 billion users globally.,"Facebook Inc quickly rejected a call from co-founder Chris Hughes on Thursday to split the world’s largest social media company in three, while lawmakers urged the US Justice Department to launch an antitrust investigation.Facebook has been under scrutiny from regulators around the world over data sharing practices as well as hate speech and misinformation on its networks. Some US lawmakers have pushed for action to break up big tech companies as well as federal privacy regulation. “We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well intentioned the leaders of these companies may be. Mark’s power is unprecedented and un-American,” Hughes, a former college roommate of Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, wrote in a lengthy New York Times opinion piece.Facebook’s social network has more than 2 billion users. It also owns WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, each used by more than 1 billion people. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Facebook rejected Hughes’ call for WhatsApp and Instagram to be made into separate companies, and said the focus should instead be on regulating the internet. Zuckerberg will be in Paris on Friday to discuss internet regulation with French President Emmanuel Macron.“Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don’t enforce accountability by calling for the break up of a successful American company,” Facebook spokesman Nick Clegg said in a statement. “Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the internet. That is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has called for.”Late on Thursday, Senator Mike Crapo, the Republican who chairs the banking committee and Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat, asked Facebook to answer questions about a potential cryptocurrency-based payments system using its social network and its data collection.The letter also asked questions about consumer privacy protections and if it had information about users’ creditworthiness. US Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, told CNBC he thinks Facebook should be broken up and that the Justice Department’s antitrust division needs to begin an investigation.Antitrust law makes such a proposal tough to execute because the government would have to take the company to court and win. It is rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&T being the two biggest examples.SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITYHughes co-founded Facebook in 2004 at Harvard with Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. He left Facebook in 2007, and has said in a LinkedIn post he made half a billion dollars for his three years of work.“It’s been 15 years since I co-founded Facebook at Harvard, and I haven’t worked at the company in a decade. But I feel a sense of anger and responsibility,” Hughes said.Facebook lost several executives after a bruising series of privacy and disinformation scandals since 2016. The founders of Instagram and WhatsApp have left, as has the executive who took over WhatsApp last year.Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, who had been at the company for 13 years and was one of Zuckerberg’s closest lieutenants, stepped down in March around the same time Facebook announced a pivot towards more private messaging.He later cited “artistic differences” with Zuckerberg as his reason for leaving, without elaborating.Critics say the company’s pivot to privacy, which will introduce more encrypted communications, will restrict Facebook’s ability to police propaganda, hate speech and other abusive behaviour. Cox focused on improving tools to catch banned content in recent years.Despite its scandals, the company’s core business has proven resilient. Facebook has blown past earnings estimates in the past two quarters and its stock price barely budged in response to Hughes’ opinion piece.Hughes suggested Zuckerberg should be held responsible for privacy and other lapses at the company, echoing a call earlier this month by Democratic U.S. Senator Ron Wyden to hold the CEO individually liable for “repeated violations” of privacy.“The government must hold Mark accountable. For too long, lawmakers have marvelled at Facebook’s explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure that Americans are protected and markets are competitive,” Hughes said.LAWMAKER PRESSURE Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election, has vowed to break up Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google if elected. “Today’s big tech companies have too much power—over our economy, our society, & our democracy. They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses & stifled innovation. It’s time to #BreakUpBigTech,” Warren said on Twitter on Thursday. Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said in a statement he agreed in retrospect that US regulators should not have approved Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp.“The way forward is to heavily scrutinize future mergers and to ensure no company has anti-competitive platform privileges,” Khanna said. In one of a number of scandals to hit the company, Facebook is accused of inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.Facebook has been in advanced talks with the US Federal Trade Commission to settle a year-old investigation and said last month it expected to spend between $3 billion and $5 billion.On Monday, Republican and Democratic US senators criticized reported plans for the settlement, calling on the FTC to impose harsher penalties and more restrictions on Facebook’s business practices.Hughes said he last met with Zuckerberg in the summer of 2017, several months before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke.“Mark is a good, kind person. But I’m angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,” Hughes said. Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s previous head of news feed who recently took over Instagram, responded to Hughes on Twitter.“Regulation is important and necessary, but I’m not convinced breaking us up is the right path. Would love to chat about it if you’re open,” Mosseri said.

36,"OnePlus 7 Pro’s vibration engine to be ‘200% stronger’ than OnePlus 6T, confirms Pete Lau",OnePlus 7 Pro users will also be able to personalise vibration intensity. ,"Vibration motors are one of the most important features of any smartphone. Weaker the motors, higher the chances of you missing calls and texts. OnePlus phones have long grappled with this issue. In fact there’s an entire Reddit thread on OnePlus’ weak vibration motors. Well, OnePlus is finally fixing this problem with its OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus CEO Pete Lau in an interview to CNET said that OnePlus 7 Pro’s vibration engine is 200% stronger than its predecessors. He also said that OnePlus 7 Pro will allow users to personalise vibration settings for notifications. Users will be able to choose between “light”, “medium”, and “strong.” One can even further personalise the vibration intensity for different tasks such as keyboard. “We are constantly listening to feedback from the community on what features and characteristics they would like to see implemented on OnePlus phones. Their feedback helps us focus on certain features,” Lau said. “Our team had to rethink the internal design of the OnePlus 7 Pro, to fit inside the body without increasing the thickness of the device, which could lead to a less ergonomic feel. At the same time, we had to ensure that the haptic motor was in the right position so that the haptics would be strong, yet even across the device,” he added. OnePlus 7 Pro will launch alongside OnePlus 7 in India on May 14. Ahead of the launch, OnePlus has already confirmed some of the features of its new premium smartphone. The latest OnePlus phone will sport a triple rear camera setup along with a notch-less screen. It will use a pop-up front-facing camera for selfies. The company has also teamed up with Netflix and National Geographic to promote the camera capabilities of OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro recently bagged DisplayMate’s A+ rating promising better colour accuracy, brightness, contract accuracy or pixel density. The phone will also be compatible with high resolution streaming on apps like Amazon Prime and Netflix. OnePlus said users will be able to personalise colour gamut and colour temperature on the phone.

38,"‘Google will never sell any personal info to third parties’, says Sundar Pichai",The CEO of Google said he believed that privacy was “one of the most important topics of our time.”,"Google will never sell any personal information of its users to third parties, CEO Sundar Pichai has said, amidst growing global concern over the misuse of personal data by some social media giants.In an opinion piece Tuesday in The New York Times, he also said that privacy cannot be a “luxury good” that is only available to people who can afford to buy premium products and services.The 46-year-old Indian-origin CEO of Google said he believed that privacy was “one of the most important topics of our time.”  People today are rightly concerned about how their information is used and shared, yet they all define privacy in their own ways, he said.   “To make privacy real, we give you clear, meaningful choices around your data. All while staying true to two unequivocal policies: that Google will never sell any personal information to third parties; and that you get to decide how your information is used,” Pichai said.Pichai said he has seen this first-hand as he talked to people in different parts of the world.   “To the families using the internet through a shared device, privacy might mean privacy from one another. To the small-business owner who wants to start accepting credit card payments, privacy means keeping customer data secure. To the teenager sharing selfies, privacy could mean the ability to delete that data in the future,” Pichai said.He noted that privacy was personal, which makes it even more vital for companies to give people clear, individual choices around how their data is used.He said legislation will help companies like Google to work toward ensuring that privacy protections are available to more people around the world.   “But we’re not waiting for it. We have a responsibility to lead. And we’ll do so in the same spirit we always have, by offering products that make privacy a reality for everyone,” Pichai said.Ideally, privacy legislation would require all businesses to accept responsibility for the impact of their data processing in a way that creates consistent and universal protections for individuals and society as a whole, he said.Google has worked hard to continually earn people’s trust by providing accurate answers and keeping their questions private, he added. “We’ve stayed focused on the products and features that make privacy a reality — for everyone,” he said in the opinion piece.“For everyone” is a core philosophy for Google; it’s built into our mission to create products that are universally accessible and useful. That’s why Search works the same for everyone, whether you’re a professor at Harvard or a student in rural Indonesia,” he said.“Our mission compels us to take the same approach to privacy. For us, that means privacy cannot be a luxury good offered only to people who can afford to buy premium products and services. Privacy must be equally available to everyone in the world,” Pichai underlined.He noted that even in cases where Google offered a paid product like YouTube Premium, which includes an ads-free experience, the regular version of YouTube has plenty of privacy controls built in. Pichai recalled that last week, Google announced significant new privacy features, including one-click access to privacy settings from all its major products and auto-delete controls that allows one to choose how long the person  want data to be saved.   “And to protect your data from security threats, we just introduced a security key built into Android phones that can provide two-factor authentication,” he said.In the future, Aritificial Intelligence (AI) will provide even more ways to make products more helpful with less data.   With increased spending on digital advertising, Google and Facebook have become forces to reckon with as millions of users, especially from emerging markets like India, go online.But multiple instances of data breaches and user information leaks have brought increased scrutiny on many platforms from regulators and governments across the globe. These companies are now walking a tightrope as they attempt to balance user privacy with increased accountability as governments seek greater disclosures and controls over digital platforms.

39,Realme X specs suggest it could be the true Redmi Note 7 Pro rival,Realme X is set to launch in China on May 15 along with Realme X Youth.,"Realme launched ‘Realme 3 Pro’ to compete with Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 7 Pro smartphone. Realme 3 Pro did take on Redmi Note 7 in some departments such as performance and selfie camera. But apart from that Realme 3 Pro just came out as an upgraded version of Realme 3. With Realme X, the company finally has the chance to outshine the rival.As pointed out in our review as well, Realme 3 Pro’s camera didn’t really surpass Redmi Note 7 Pro’s. Realme X is expected to fix this with 48-megapixel camera with Sony IMX586 sensor – exactly the same sensor that runs on Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 7 Pro. Realme is also stepping up the design game with notch-less 6.5-inch full HD+ edge-to-edge screen with a pop-up selfie camera. The phone is likely to come with 48-megapixel and 5-megapixel sensors on the back and 16-megapixel selfie camera. For performance, it will rely on an octa-core processor clocked at 2.2GHz with 4GB RAM and 64GB built-in storage. Another differentiator will be the in-screen fingerprint sensor – which is exclusive to few premium smartphones such as OnePlus 6T. Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 doesn’t have this feature. Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 7 Pro comes with 48-megapixel rear camera, Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 processor, 6.3-inch full HD+ dot notch display, Corning Gorilla Glass 5, Type-C Port, 4,000mAh battery, and up to 6GB of RAM.Xiaomi, however, is already working on an improved Redmi phone, dubbed as Redmi X. The phone is confirmed to run on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 processor. It is also expected to come with a pop-up selfie camera, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storage. The smartphone could feature a 6.39-inch full HD+ display and feature a triple-rear camera setup.

41,"Binance hackers shift stolen bitcoin, identity still unclear, say researchers","According to London-based blockchain analytics company Coinfirm, the hackers have moved the stolen bitcoin through several digital wallets, with almost all the coins now sitting in seven digital addresses. ","Hackers who stole bitcoin worth over $40 million from the major Binance cryptocurrency exchange have moved the tainted coins to a number of digital wallets, researchers said on Thursday, potentially throwing up clues to those behind the heist.Binance, one of the world’s biggest exchanges, said on Wednesday that hackers had stolen around 7,000 bitcoin through phishing and viruses, the latest in a string of cryptocurrency thefts to hit exchanges across the world.    According to London-based blockchain analytics company Coinfirm, the hackers have moved the stolen bitcoin through several digital wallets, with almost all the coins now sitting in seven digital addresses. Theft remains a major problem for the emerging cryptocurrency sector, with high profile hacks alarming regulators and raising questions for larger investors over whether digital coins can be safely stored and traded.     Losses of digital coins from hacks and fraud hit $1.2 billion between January and March, around 70 percent of the level for all of 2018.   Although the movement of cryptocurrencies can be traced, the identity and location of the hackers or owners of the wallets holding the stolen coins is unknown, Coinfirm said.Still, the findings may offer clues to the identity of the hackers. To convert bitcoin to traditional money, hackers would have to move the stolen coins to a cryptocurrency exchange, which usually require details of account holders’ identities. But such checks are, in reality, far from watertight, said Pawel Alexsander, Coinfirm’s chief information officer.QUICK RESPONSE“Exchanges are obliged to have KYC (know-your-customer) processes in place. In practice, many of them do not do this properly,” he said. “People can open fake accounts, and deposit the funds to that account.”     Binance, which is based in Malta but has over 400 workers spread across more than 40 countries, was the highest profile exchange to be hit since hackers stole cryptocurrency worth $530 million dollars from the Tokyo-based Coincheck in January 2018.   A Binance spokeswoman did not immediately respond to calls and messages seeking comment.  Cryptocurrency markets have largely shrugged off the Binance hack, with bitcoin last up 1 percent at around $6,000, its highest since mid-November. Analysts and traders said that was down to Binance’s relatively quick response to the hack. CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a website post on Wednesday that the company would use a fund to cover users’ losses. Coinfirm has 130 clients across the world in the cryptocurrency sector and traditional finance, from wallet providers to exchanges, as well as one of Japan’s three megabanks.

45,Facebook co-founder says it is time to break up the company,Chris Hughes co-founded Facebook in 2004 at Harvard with the company’s Chief Executive Officer Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. He quit Facebook in 2007 and later said in a LinkedIn post that he made half a billion dollars for his three years of work.,"Facebook Inc co-founder and former Mark Zuckerberg roommate Chris Hughes has called for the break up of the social network in an opinion piece in the New York Times. “We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well intentioned the leaders of these companies may be. Mark’s power is unprecedented and un-American,” Hughes wrote.Facebook owns the largest social network with more than 2 billion users across the world. It also owns WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, each used by more than 1 billion people. Hughes co-founded Facebook in 2004 at Harvard with the company’s Chief Executive Officer Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. He quit Facebook in 2007 and later said in a LinkedIn post that he made half a billion dollars for his three years of work.“It’s been 15 years since I co-founded Facebook at Harvard, and I haven’t worked at the company in a decade. But I feel a sense of anger and responsibility,” said Hughes, who later was  an online strategist for Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign.The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In one of a number of security and privacy scandals to hit the company, Facebook is accused of inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Hughes said he last met with Zuckerberg in the summer of 2017, several months before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke.“Mark is a good, kind person. But I’m angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,” Hughes said.“And I’m worried that Mark has surrounded himself with a team that reinforces his beliefs instead of challenging them.”Hughes is not alone in asking for break-up of Facebook. Some lawmakers have called for federal privacy regulation and anti-trust action to break up big tech companies.Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren in March vowed to break up Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google if elected U.S. president to promote competition in the tech sector.

47,"Wireless signals bounce off humans, collect health data",The system called “Marko” transmits a low-power radio-frequency (RF) signal into the environment. The signal returns to the system with certain changes if it has bounced off a moving human. ,"Scientists from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have devised a wireless movement-tracking system that uses radio frequency signals -- flowing around us and bouncing off our bodies -- and helps collect health and behavioural data.The system called “Marko” transmits a low-power radio-frequency (RF) signal into the environment. The signal returns to the system with certain changes if it has bounced off a moving human. Novel algorithms then analyse those changed reflections and associate them with specific individuals. The system then traces each individual’s movement around a digital floor plan. Matching these movement patterns with other data can provide insights about how people interact with each other and the environment, say researchers. “These are interesting bits we discovered through data. We live in a sea of wireless signals and the way we move and walk around changes these reflections,” said study first author Chen-Yu Hsu, a PhD student in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT.  “We developed the system that listens to those reflections... to better understand people’s behaviour and health,” he added in a paper presented this week at the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in Glasgow, Scotland. The researchers describe the system and its real-world use in six locations -- two assisted living facilities, three apartments inhabited by couples, and one townhouse with four residents. The case studies demonstrated the system’s ability to distinguish individuals based solely on wireless signals -- and revealed some useful behavioural patterns.This is how the system works.When deployed in a home, “Marko” shoots out an RF signal. When the signal rebounds, it creates a type of heat map cut into vertical and horizontal “frames,” which indicates where people are in a three-dimensional (3D) space. People appear as bright blobs on the map. Vertical frames capture the person’s height and build, while horizontal frames determine their general location. As individuals walk, the system analyses the RF frames -- about 30 per second -- to generate short trajectories, called tracklets.A Machine Learning (ML) model commonly used for image processing uses those tracklets to separate reflections by certain individuals. Combining all the information -- height, build, and movement -- the network associates specific RF reflections with specific individuals. The sensors never have to be charged, and, after training, the individuals don’t need to wear them again. In home deployments, “Marko” was able to tag the identities of individuals in new homes with between 85 and 95 percent accuracy, said researchers. The research was led by Dina Katabi, the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Director of the MIT Center for Wireless Networks and Mobile Computing (Wireless@MIT).

49,Instagram updating content-banning policies on app,"Up until now, Instagram relied on a policy that allowed “a certain percentage” of violations within a window of time before it decides to ban someone. ","As part of its efforts to curb the spread of false information, conspiracy theories and hate on its platform, Instagram is implementing a policy change concerning the removal of posts violating content norms based on accumulated negative strikes, as well as content bans.Instagram has said that with its new policy, accounts will be removed after an undisclosed amount of violations and an undisclosed window of time. And it’ll be the same bar for every user, regardless of how often they post on the app, Engadget reported on Wednesday. Up until now, Instagram relied on a policy that allowed “a certain percentage” of violations within a window of time before it decides to ban someone. The company said it doesn’t want to share the exact number of strikes it will put in place, or the timeframe for them, because it doesn’t want bad actors to take advantage of the system, the report added.Earlier this week, the photo-messaging app decided to run posts going viral on its app through Facebook fact-checkers to ensure the credibility of the posts. Instagram also announced that it would soon allow users to appeal posts that have been taken down, directly from inside the app.
